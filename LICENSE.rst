The "Playtime With Hot Toddies" font is not licensed, but was found on `Font Squirrel`_, and is also in the KS source, which is released as CC-BY-ND. We follow the legal opinion of Font Squirrel, as below:

    This font was found on the internet and did not come with a license. While we try to make sure that all the fonts on fontsquirrel.com are properly licensed for commercial use, there are many fonts that have either been abandoned by their authors or the authors distribute their fonts without an explicit license.

    It is our opinion that if the unlicensed font is freely available for download from either the original source or from multiple free-font sites then we assume it to be safe to use the font commercially. This is no guarantee of such freedom, but there are so many unlicensed free fonts distributed by primary sources that the intentions must be read that the font is free to use how you like.

Ren'Py (``unrpyc/renpy``) is distributed under the MIT license, in ``unrpyc/renpy/LICENSE.txt``.

Git submodules are not included as part of the source, and are licensed separately. See their respective subdirectories for more information.

All other source code (i.e. mine) is licensed under the `GPLv3`_ license.

unrpyc itself used to be under the MIT license, but I have relicensed it as GPL 3.0. Where this is not legal, the contents of that subdirectory are available under the MIT license; however, the rest of the source code remains under GPL 3.0, unless otherwise noted above.
