This is an overview of the layout of the code.

ast2json/ decompiles rpyc from the distribution to JSON so that it can be parsed
with JSON.parse on the client side.

js/html5ks.js is the main entry point; this initializes the code then calls
the init function in the submodules. It also manages transforms to fit the
container to the window.

js/imachine.js interprets instructions from imachine.json to jump to scenes,
play videos, and select branches as appropriate based on choices.

js/api.js effectively runs script.json, dispatching commands to functions
which operate on the DOM.

js/menu.js manages the main menu, context menu, and options menu.
