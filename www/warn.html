    <p>Okay, before we start, we need to go through a few things first.</p>
    <p>If you don't know what Katawa Shoujo is, see <a href="http://www.katawa-shoujo.com/">http://www.katawa-shoujo.com/</a>, then come back.</p>
    <p>The full version of Katawa Shoujo contains adult material.<br>
    Promise that you are over <b>18 years</b> old and that you will not make the material available to persons below that age.
    </p>
    <p>Also, please don't bother the original developers on the forums or IRC about bugs in this. This is entirely unofficial and not controlled by them whatsoever.<br>
    This includes typos, graphical misplacement, downtime, and any other glitches of any sort. Bug me instead: <a href="https://bugzilla.happinessforme.com/">https://bugzilla.happinessforme.com/</a>, or use the official distribution until HTML5KS is feature-complete.
