This is a WIP HTML5 implementation of the game Katawa Shoujo. [0]

== Requirements ==
- Katawa Shoujo (obviously)
- Firefox/Chrome/a sensible browser (i.e. not IE)
- Bash
- ffmpeg with fdk-aac, libtheora, libvpx, libx264
- opusenc from opus-tools
- cwebp and webpmux from libwebp

=== Recommended ===
- nginx
- zopfli

== How to use ==
1. Navigate to http://html5ks.happinessforme.com/

== How to build ==
0. Get Katawa Shoujo.
1. Copy *.rpyc from Katawa Shoujo/game into unrpyc/ directory.
2. Extract files from Katawa Shoujo/game/data.rpa with an rpa extractor, e.g. unrpa. Put files in www/dump.
3. Run setup.sh. [2]

4. Run nginx.sh to start nginx, then navigate to localhost:8080 in your browser.
-- or --
4. Open www/index.html in a browser.

== Reducing setup time ==
To reduce the setup time (many hours), try the following:

Turn off zopflipng recompression by passing ZOPFLIPNG=: as an environment variable to setup.sh. It saves only a few MB but takes several hours to complete, depending on CPU. Useful if you're serving many, MANY copies, but not useful if you're serving one locally.

== Reducing file size ==
Run `make space`. Warning: This will remove source files from dump.
