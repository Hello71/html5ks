This is an HTML5 implementation of the game Katawa Shoujo. [0]

jQuery is not used, but when.js [1] is used as a sensible Promises/A+ implementation.

It's still very much a WIP, but at least the first scene displays half-credibly.

How to use:
0. Get Katawa Shoujo.
1. Follow steps in unrpyc/README
2. Extract files from data.rpa with an appropriate tool. Put files in www/dump.
3. Run setup.sh [2] to re-encode and fix up files. Use environment variable THREADS to control number of threads/processes spawned.

4. Run nginx.sh [2] to start nginx with appropriate options for development, then connect to localhost:8080.
-- or --
4. Open www/index.html in a browser. This is untested, and some things may not work. [3]

lighttpd.conf is no longer maintained. Patches to fix it are welcome.

Check Bugzilla for things that need to be done. [4]

If you were looking for real documentation... good luck.
