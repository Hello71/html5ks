This is an HTML5 implementation of the game Katawa Shoujo. [0]

jQuery is not used, but when.js [1] is used as a sensible Promises/A+ implementation.

It's still very much a WIP, but at least the first scene displays half-credibly.

Run nginx.sh to start nginx with appropriate options for development, then connect to localhost:8080.

lighttpd -f lighttpd.conf should also work, but is not actively tested.

Check Bugzilla for things that need to be done. [2]
