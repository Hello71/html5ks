This is a WIP HTML5 implementation of the game Katawa Shoujo. [0]

jQuery is not used, but when.js [1] is used as a sensible Promises/A+ implementation.

== Requirements ==
- Katawa Shoujo (obviously)
- when.js
- Bash
- Firefox/Chrome/a sensible browser
- ffmpeg with fdk-aac, libtheora, libvpx, libx264
- opusenc from opus-tools
- cwebp from libwebp
- zopfli
- nginx

How to use:
0. Get Katawa Shoujo.
1. Copy *.rpyc from Katawa Shoujo/game into unrpyc/ directory.
2. Extract files from data.rpa with an rpa extractor, e.g. unrpa. Put files in www/dump.
3. Run setup.sh.

4. Run nginx.sh [2] to start nginx with appropriate options for development, then connect to localhost:8080.
-- or --
4. Open www/index.html in a browser. This is untested, and some things may not work. [3]

lighttpd.conf is no longer maintained. Patches to fix it are welcome.

== Reducing setup time ==
By editing the Makefile, you can turn on or off the various encodings. To reduce the setup time (many hours), try the following:

Turn off zopflipng recompression by commenting it out. It saves only a few MB but takes several hours to complete. Useful if you're serving many, MANY copies, but not useful if you're serving one locally.

== Reducing file size ==
[TODO]
