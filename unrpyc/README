This is a !@#$ed up version of unrpyc to generate sort-of JSON from Ren'Py .rpyc files.

It's made for Katawa Shoujo script files; trying to use it on anything else will probably break horribly.

How to use:

1. Copy Ren'Py distribution into "renpy" folder.
2. Execute "2to3 -w renpy/*.py".
3. Put the rpyc files from the official KS distribution in here.
4. Run "make" with appropriate -j options (yay auto-parallelization)
5. Run "make install".

If you want to hack on the code, have fun. This is all the documentation you get.
