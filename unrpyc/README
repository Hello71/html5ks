This is a !@#$ed up version of unrpyc to generate sort-of JSON from Ren'Py .rpyc files.

It's made for Katawa Shoujo script files; trying to use it on anything else will probably break horribly.

How to use:

1. Put the rpyc files from the official KS distribution in here.
2. Run "make install".

If you're on Windows, sucks for you. Use a better OS.

If you want to hack on the code, have fun. The code sucks, and this is all the documentation you get.
